Hi there! I am a passionate Data Scientist with a strong background in data analysis, model development, and project management. I specialize in Python, R, and SQL and have experience with a variety of statistics libraries and tools. Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my skill set by learning Power BI.

Throughout my career, I have worked in analytical roles spanning the fields of medicine, public health, retail, transit, and travel. My current work has led me to a contract position evaluating Large Language Models on their ability to accomplish Python and SQL-related tasks. This work is crucial for the pursuit of improved AI, even though robust evaluation has proven tricky. Learn more about my contributions [here](https://scale.com/leaderboard). 

Previously, as a Data Scientist at Preteckt, I led model development projects predict engine malfunctions for commercial vehicles using Python and SQL, with the aim of reducing misclassifications by 25% (Learn more [on their site](https://preteckt.com)). Demonstrating my skills at this position quickly expanded my role to producing a variety of visualizations and reports surrounding company performance. As a Research Data Analyst at the University of Pittsburgh, I developed inferential and predictive models using a variety of regression and machine learning techniques, collaborating with researchers to solve complex problems in oncology, radiology, and public health. My ability to transform raw data into actionable insights, along with presenting findings, has been a consistent part of my contributions across these fields.

I earned my MA and BSc in Statistics from the University of Pittsburgh. More about me here!
