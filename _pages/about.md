Hi there! I am a passionate Data Scientist with expertise in data analysis, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision-making. I specialize in Python, R, and SQL, and I’m advancing my skills by learning Power BI. I'm continuously expanding my skill set to stay at the forefront of the data science field.

My career has led me to bump shoulders with a myriad of industries such as medicine, public health, transportation, and retail. Currently, I’m engaged in a contract role where I assess Large Language Models (LLMs) for their ability to execute Python and SQL-related tasks, a critical aspect of enhancing AI capabilities in real-world applications. Learn more about my contributions [here](https://scale.com/leaderboard/coding).

Previously, as a Data Scientist at Preteckt, I led data modeling projects aimed at predicting engine failures in commercial vehicles, using Python, R, and SQL. My efforts helped reduce misclassifications by nearly 20%. At the same time, I assisted in developing impactful data visualizations that drove key business decisions. At the University of Pittsburgh, as a Research Data Analyst, I developed statistical and machine learning models to solve complex problems in fields like oncology and radiology, collaborating with researchers to transform raw data into actionable insights.

I earned both my MA and BSc in Statistics from the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu), where I honed my skills in experimental design, machine learning, and data visualization. It also gave me some indispensable experience as a leader and teacher. My academic experience provided a solid foundation for tackling challenging analytical problems and equipped me with the skills to work across diverse industries.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, weightlifting, making music, and watching classic sci-fi movies.
